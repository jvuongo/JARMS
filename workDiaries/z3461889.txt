Week 1

Group formed. I wrote the problem domain, existing work/systems, and their drawbacks sections of the proposal. I also discussed with the team all available 
software tools and libraries that we can use for the project.

Week 2

I wrote the 'Describes how some of the defined user stories to be implemented provide novel functionality compared to existing systems' section of the proposal. 
I also spent time with our group to discuss our potential project objectives in writing out our user stories and acceptance criteria on our Jira board.

Week 3

* Following discussion with my teammates, I have assigned myself to take responsibility for our underlying email system and the QR code system for the first 
  sprint during weeks 3 and 4.
* I finished implementing the underlying email system for all of the notifications on our system. I finished writing the code to send an email to the registered 
  user upon successful account creation along with the email template to be sent (User story JP-72). I have also written the first version of the code to send an 
  email to the user upon a successful event booking transaction along with the email template to be sent (JP-63).
* The QR code system (JP-74) is planned for next week.

Week 4

* As evidenced in the last work diary entry, the plan for this week was the implementation of the QR code system (JP-74) in addition to making sure the user 
  stories I was assigned to are able to be demonstrated in progressive demo A.
* I finished writing the final version of the code to send an email to the user upon a successful event booking transaction along with the email template to be
  sent (JP-63) and the code to display a ticket with a QR code in addition to ticket fields which are fetched from our backend.
* I faced some non-technical obstacles during this week due to my progress being blocked and reliant on the ticket backend which was set to be completed by 
  another member. The issue was discussed in our standups during the week and was a key point of improvement for our retrospective. 
* Nevertheless, I tried to overcome this obstacle by making adjustments to start experimenting with the code for our underlying payment system facilitated via 
  the PayPal API (JP-90) for the next sprint to ensure the overall project progress is not significantly affected.
* Discussion and allocation of responsibilities for the next sprint are planned at the start of next week.

Week 5

* Following discussion with my teammates, I have assigned myself to take responsibility for our ticket system (JP-22, JP-89, JP-107) and payment system (JP-90) 
  for the second sprint during weeks 5 and 7.
* I finished making a change to the QR code implementation to improve demo feasibility. I also finished the frontend implementation of the ticket with full 
  backend integration (JP-89) in addition to the implementation of the cancellation of tickets (JP-22). Furthermore, I implemented the 'My Tickets' tab where 
  a user is able to see all the tickets that are in their ownership (JP-107).
* I was able to finish everything I planned for this week and thus have good overall project progress towards my individual commitment for the second
  sprint. I aim to continue to work at this pace to overcome any obstacles that may arise and affect our team and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the
  success of our project.
* The payment system (JP-90) is planned for next week.

Week 6

* As evidenced in the last work diary entry, the plan for this week was the implementation of the payment system (JP-90) in addition to making sure the user 
  stories I was assigned to are able to be demonstrated in progressive demo B.
* I finished writing the final version of the code to integrate the PayPal payment system (JP-90) into our project where a user is forwarded to checkout a paid
  event booking via PayPal which then attaches a PayPal Transaction ID onto a user's ticket. Furthermore, I implemented the refund system (JP-114) and email 
  system (JP-73) for when an event is cancelled where all tickets associated to a cancelled paid event are refunded and attendees are emailed of the cancellation 
  of the event.
* Akin to the previous week, I was able to finish everything I planned for this week and thus have continued to have good overall project progress towards my 
  individual commitment for the second sprint. Again, I aim to continue to work at this pace to overcome any obstacles that may arise in our final sprint to 
  ensure the success of our project.
* Discussion and allocation of responsibilities for the final sprint are planned at the start of next week.

Week 7

* Following discussion with my teammates, I have assigned myself to take responsibility for the event recommendation system (JP-109) and the friend 
  recommendation system (JP-75) for the final sprint during weeks 7 and 10.
* I finished writing the final version of the code to recommend events to the user (JP-109) into our project where a logged in user will be recommended
  events based on the types of events that they have attended in the past, the hosts of the events that they've attended in the past and similar descriptions
  of events. This is implemented through the use of the Recombee recommendation engine where users and events are synchronised and their interactions are
  sent to the engine facilitated through custom recommendation logic which provides us with recommendations.
* I was able to finish a significant component of the project that being the recommendaton system as planned and thus have good overall project progress
  towards my individual commitment for the final sprint. I aim to continue to work at this pace to finish the remaining recommendation system involving
  friends and set some time to overcome any obstacles that may arise and affect our team and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the success of our 
  project.
* The friend recommendation system (JP-109) is planned for next week.

Week 8

* As evidenced in the last work diary entry, the plan for this week was the implementation of the friend recommendation system (JP-75).
* I finished writing the final version of the code to recommend friends to the user (JP-75) where a logged in user will be recommended friends based on the 
  types of events that they specify that they are interested in, events that they've attended in the past and having mutual friends. This is implemented 
  through the use of the Recombee recommendation engine where users are synchronised and their interactions are sent to the engine facilitated through custom 
  recommendation logic which provides us with recommendations. Furthermore, I added the functionality for an event host to be able to broadcast a message 
  through an email to all bookees of their event to facilitate communication if necessary.
* I was able to finish another significant component of the project that being the friend recommendaton system as planned and thus have met my individual 
  commitment for the final sprint. I aim to continue to work at this pace until the end of the project to overcome any obstacles that may arise and make 
  adjustments as necessary.
* For next week, I plan to write my sections of the report, fix any issues with the features i have implemented if they arise, and work on any additional 
  functionality we may pursue if necessary.
  
  Week 9

* As evidenced in the last work diary entry, the plan for this week was to write my sections of the report, fix any minor issues of the features I have
  implemented and work on any minor additional functionalities as necessary.
* In terms of the report, I finished writing the sections of the report for the payment system(RSVP/Purchase ticket), email system, event recommendation
  system and the friend recommendation system. I also wrote my sections on the usage of third-party libraries and wrote two implementation challenges 
  regarding the use of PayPal API and Recombee.
* In terms of the project, I added pagination to the social page and implemented modals to show all friends and all invites. Furthermore, I also revamped 
  the user interface of the user profile modal that we had previously.
